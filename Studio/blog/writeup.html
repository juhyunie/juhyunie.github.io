			<li>times were simpler, today - fastpaced</li>
			<li>technology wasn’t as big of a part in our lives as it is now</li>
			<li>many people say it was the best time to live life </li>
			<li>theres so much going on these days - can be overwhelming</li>
			<li>people are never not looking at something on a screen</li>
			<li>back in the day people would interact with each other face to face more due to lack of technology</li>
			<li>lack of technology —> happier?</li>
			<li>picture taking wasn’t as easy and convenient back then</li>
			<li>picture sharing is harder —> more human contact? </li>
			<li>moments were more valuable?</li>
			<li>when listening to the radio, i had to wait for songs that I didn’t want to listen to end, and hope that the next would be a good one </li>
			<li>nowadays, I assume people don’t have the patience to listen to songs they want to listen to - and ways of connecting music and accessing them became so much more diverse and convenient</li>
			<li>- funny usernames o0jkh0tp1nk0o, xx_honeybuns_xx etc. </li>
			<li>- paper and pen games: MARSH (where would you live, who would you marry</li>
			<li>- note passing in class - now kids secretly text? </li>

						WASSILY ARMCHAIR - 1926 <br>
						The Wassily Chair, also known as the Model B3 chair, was designed by Marcel Breuer in 1926 while he was the head of the cabinet-making workshop at the Bauhaus (Dessau, Germany). In 1925, Breuer bought his first bicycle. He was so impressed by its lightness and strength that he had decided to make furniture from tubular steel. The Wassily Chair’s design remains progressive even in comparison to the design world’s latest furniture.  Its build is complex in appearance but simple in construction, a contrast which has earned its place in museums throughout the world, and in thousands of modern-minded homes. Revolutions in design are most often driven by advancements in material and technology.  The famous Wassily Chair by Marcel Breuer is precisely one of these, the first ever chair to feature a bent-steel frame.  While it was first created in 1926, it marked the beginning of a new era in modern furniture with a design that maintains a progressive look even today.

						AIR MAX 93 <br>
						First known as the Air Max 270, due to its much-hyped 270-degree Air unit, the Air Max 93 provided more air than ever before with an entirely visible Air unit that extended to the back of the heel. The shoe's molding evolved to create a new standard of cushioning which included Air cushions that adapted to the shape of the foot. Designer Tinker Hatfield created the Air Max 93 shoe as an artistic celebration of Air technology. This was the first Air Max product to have a top line bootie construction technique to improve comfort. The blow molded cushioning unit that was visible around the entire heel would be affectionately dubbed “the bubble.” The prominent “bubble” reflected a refined yet provocative line of thought in Nike technology.

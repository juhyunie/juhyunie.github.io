						ELYSEE ARMCHAIR - 1972 <br>
						Pierre Paulin, the late French furniture designer who died in 2009, outfitted apartments for presidents, designed steam irons for housewives and created perfume bottles for Courreges. Mushrooms, oysters, tongues, and tulips are some of the iconic shapes French designer Pierre Paulin was best known for creating. Having trained under Parisian designer Marcel Gascion, Paulin was influenced by the Scandinavian aesthetic as well as American pre-fabricated designs by Charles and Ray Eames and Florence Knoll. Nicolas Ghesquiere, the artistic director of Louis Vuitton, spent his childhood in the '70s surrounded by the stuff. "When you see those things," says Ghesquiere, now a Paulin collector and one of the designer's contemporary champions, "you don't forget them". Paulin's chairs not only offered an invitation to relax and lounge; they also took the temperature of the times. In Paris in the late 1960s, social unrest was in the air and "young people wanted to have a new life". Paulin's forward-looking, innovative designs for affordable chairs, divans, and sofas in an array of bright and vivid colors can be found in contemporary art and design collections around the world, from the Museum of Modern Art, New York to the Victoria and Albert Museum, London and the National Centre for Art and Culture Georges Pompidou in Paris.

						NIKE AIR FLIGHT '89<br>
						Released in 1989, the Flight '89 was a special model most notably because it was the last that mirrored the silhouette of an Air Jordan sneaker. It was at this time that the Air Jordan brand became its own entity, forging a new path and wading in uncharted basketball sneaker waters. From this shoe alone was born number of signature shoes for stellar athletes around the NBA. Nicknamed "Flights", they featured the same sole as the Air Jordan IV,  with visible air bubble and the straps on both sides and retailed for $89.99.

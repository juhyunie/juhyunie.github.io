		RINGTONES	
	</h2>

	<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;
	"By 2007 ringtones had indeed taken over the world. You heard them everywhere. By then those that were internet savvy were making their own by using audio editing programs. A whole generation of kids and young adults were getting accustomed and it affected rap and hip-hop unlike any other genre.
	<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;
	There was a moment in time where your ringtone was just a natural part of the cellphone experience, it played when you called, texted, or in the background as a ringback. Much like MySpace at the time, it was just something you imagined would be around forever. Now though, the days where cell phones would ring and the latest catchy song would jingle from its speakers are a distant memory.
	Phones simply don’t ring like they used to – texting, tweeting, Vines and all other forms of social interaction have replaced the phone's most basic function. When they do ring it’s either in silence, on vibrate, or the generic default tone that came with the cellular device. It’s a rare occasion to be in a public setting and hear a short snippet play from a nearby pocket, I literally can't remember the last time I had a ringtone, it's been years. I don't even know how to make a ringtone on my iPhone.
	<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Things were actually easier when phones were small and simple instead of large and smart. It’s amazing how an era that completely dominated the music industry is now just another relic of what was. Nothing ever feels temporary in the moment but all waves come to an end, much like high school."
